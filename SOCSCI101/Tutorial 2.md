## What is life ?

Complicated definition.

Dawkins answers why we should care. "Words are only tools for our use". Define what we study.

## Replication and genes

Here "genes" = bit of DNA that replicates (evolutionary definition). Genes are the units of selection.

We look at replicators : memes, music tunes, chain mails...

Evolution is not just about survival. It also needs replication. It's also about having an ESS (Nash equilibrium). Competition comes from scarcity.
