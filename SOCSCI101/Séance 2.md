# Séance 2 - Trade-off and ESS

## Put on more fat ?

Great tit (Mésange charbonnière) -> looses 15% weight overnight, regain wight during the afternoon, sharply.

Answer :  how does it maximize the fitness ?

It's a trade-off between risk of starvation and risk of being predated upon.

Constraint between starvation and predation => fat allows movement on only one dimension. Optimal strategy is somewhat intermediate (minimize the risk depending on the shape of the trade-off).

Make predictions :

- Fat reserves higher when risk of starvation is higher
- Fat reserves lower when risk of predation is higher

Testing hypothesis :

- Study different species of birds
- Compare different individuals among a same population
  - Study fat reserves as a function of the starvation/predation risk of the environment.
  - Phenotypic plasticity showed by birds = they can adapt to the environment
  - Sparrow-hawk introduced to the environment -> great tit go thinner

Hierarchy between great tits, what's the link between rank and fat ?

- Dominance : win conflicts. More stable resources => don't need to put on fat.
- This prediction is actually verified
- They plastically adapt when their rank evolve

## How many children to have ?

Too many offsprings will deplete the resources of the environment => reproductive restrain. False reasonning. Why ? Natural selection is a local process. (rem: is it a Markov process?)

Is it an evolutionary equilibrium ? Can a mutant strive ? No, self-restrain is not stable. Mutants will spread.

We need a **evolutionary stable strategy**. Once such a strategy is implemented in the species, all the other strategies are beaten. It is stable in front of evolution. Fixation of mutants => gradient descent (rem : deep learning ? can we study deep learning at the light of evolution ?)

Good for the group : not an ESS.

Maximize the number of children that will survive and reproduce. -> trade-off between sheer number and the survivability

- Theory tested and proved by artificially changing the number of eggs in the nest
  - Predicted ESS based on the experimental data
  - Why is the clutch size lower than prediction ?
    - Lifetime reproductive success, not only this year

## Feeding or checking for predators ?

Example of the ostrich (colonial birds)

Can eat all the time (but it's not looking for predators). Opposite strategy : always be vigilant. Trade-off between resource intake and predation risk. Group behaviour ?

There can't be an "agreed" strategy (phenotype) => a free-rider can evolve and have a higher fitness. => not an ESS

- Low vigilance group -> vigilant mutant has better fitness

- High vigilance group -> free-rider has better fitness

-> group equilibrium arises on its own. Can be represented on Pairwise Invadability Plot

## Applications

Evolution for the good of the species or the individual ? Used not to be clear. We know now that it is about the survival of the replicator (standpoint changed in the 70s)

Penguins group up to heat, but they all want to be in the middle.

Wolves hunt in pack because they are better off part of a group.
