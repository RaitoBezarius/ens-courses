INTRODUCTION TO EVOLUTIONARY ANTHROPOLOGY
INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN BEHAVIOUR
(presentations on schoology)

Goal
> introduce concepts and tools needed to study human behvours in evolutionary terms
> understand natural selection

Topics : human behaviour | human societies
> cooperation : morality, sympathy | social norms, solidarity
> Signaling : reputation management | honor
> Sexual selection : mating | courtship
> parental investment : parental care | kinship
> pair-bonding : love, sexual contol, sexual conficts | mariage
> life history : developement | life cycle
> plasticity : learning | culture
Applied to both human behaviour and human society

Next step : social cognition | cultural evolution
Next year : psychology and public policies | Communication and trust


Interesting books on the topic (pop science books) :
> Dawkins : The Selfish Gene
> Stewart - Willias : How the mind and culture evolve, the ape that understood the universe

Textbooks :
> Introduction to behavioural ecology
> Human evolutionary psychology
> Evolution and genetics for psychology
> Evolutionary psychology

Homework : cf schoology

Class 1 :
Introduction to evolution by natural selection

Darwin's natural evolution
> he solved the problem of adaptation
-> argument back in the days : argument from design -> animals work like clockwork
--> probability to get a functionnal mechanism from shuffling the mechanical elements => hence a creator, right?
bees -> a lot of complicated behaviour, very complex composition -> same conculution as the watch. same for every living organism
Solution to this mystery = natural selection

3 conditions for evolution by natural selection
1. variation
2. heritabiliy
3. selection

ex : how can human height evolve ?

Variation : some people are taller, some are smaller
Plot a height distribution (not a dirac)

Heritability : offsping will have similar traits as parents. regression (~correlation) between parents and offspring
ex : birth date is not heritable
ex : height is heritable

Selection : ex : only people taller than x will survive and reproduce. generally not deterministic and soft transition
	> fitness (survivability, repoductibiliy...)

This leads to evolution by natural selection


Practice : example

Samotherium ==ancestor (presumably) ==> giraffe
evolution by natural selection

Population evolve, not the induviduals
No single individual needs to change
The composition of the population have changed

Don't be confused by plasticiy/epigenetics : adaptation aquired by evolution

Darwin didn't know about genetics
Today, we can explain evolution in terms of change in gene frequency

ex : human height
It is determined by at least 180 genes
ex : HMGA2 (chromosome 12) has an effect i.e. different alleles (S and T) have, in average, different heights (S : smaller, T: taller)
If S has fitness f, T has fitness F
If F > f, individuals with the T allele will spread and eventually be fixed.
In reality : chance and evolution, noise (cf genetic drift)

Replicator (ex genes, viruses...) : can replicate itself
Evolution will necessarily happen in replicators (because they replicate with some errors).

How fast can evolution can go?
Double fitness with 20% initially population => 5 generations to fix the allele
Increase fitness by 10% : ~Â 25 generations

ex: Galapagos finches : very varied
From 1973 onwards, the Grants studied intensely these birds on a specific island (Daphne Major)
Bigger beak : faster at openning the seeds than the small beaks
Major drought (1977) : only hard seeds. Many birds died
Next generation : beak size increased by 15% in one year
(1982) heavy rain : beak size decreased again
Same with the beak shape

ex: House sparrow (moineau domestique)
> 0.05% increase of weight per year (average, approx per generation)
If whales evolved at the same rate (0.05% per generation), thay would weigh e215kg.
They would only need 20 000 generations to evolve to their weight.

Same idea with qualitative traits.
ex : eye shape
Samll improvements apprearing by random genetic mutatios and favored by natural selection
Different shape : more area for photoreceptors
Retina, lens...
Evolved several times independantly

Natural selection produces complex adaptation that would have been extraordinarily unlikely to occur by pure chance at once.

This asks the why question

Evolutionary biology is understood in terms of adaptation
Understanding the function explains a lot about the organism

> Application to human psychology

Proximate and ultimate causes
ex : why do humans like sugar?
-> it tastes good / humans have receptors to glucose and are connected to the reward system (proximate cause)
-> liking glucose increases anindividual's fitness (ultimate cause) = what we are interested in this course

proximate : how
ultimate : why

Not needed to be aware of the fitness increase to like sugar

Why do we like children?
proximate : they are cuuute <3 (there are several traits associated with cuteness)
ultimate : mammals need to take care of their children (unless they die) cute = who needs care

A spieces would have a cuteness detector only if it needs to take care of the offsping
Young apes have been observed to be playing with dolls

Humans are more specialized in eating dense (in terms of nutrients) food but need more resources and skills (killing a large game for instance)

Producing a net worth is starting at ~15yo and completed at ~20yo (in terms of food for hunter/gatherers). Before : leeching and learning
	(life history)

-> cuteness is needed to achieve a good training and needed to produce a lot of food afterwards

Question: why do we take care of elder people, because they don't produce anymore.
-> 3 generation society
Grandparental care. Don't produce food directly but help grandchildren and increase productivity in the end
Humans can take care of many children at once, contrary to chimps

Love?
Pair-bonding help having a stable relationship and take care of children
